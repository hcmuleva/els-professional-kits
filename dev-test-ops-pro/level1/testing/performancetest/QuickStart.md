Quick Start Performance Testing:
Install K6 (1 minute)
brew install k6           # macOS
choco install k6          # Windows
sudo apt install k6       # Linux
Run Tests (2 minutes)
# Level 1: Basic
k6 run performance/level1-basic.js

# Level 2: Data-driven  
k6 run performance/level2-datadriven.js

# Level 3: Advanced
k6 run performance/level3-advanced.js
Expected Results
âœ“ Response time (p95): < 500ms (Level 1)
âœ“ Response time (p95): < 800ms (Level 2)
âœ“ Response time (p95): < 1000ms (Level 3)
âœ“ Error rate: < 1-5%
âœ“ All checks passing

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
âœ… Progressive Learning
Level 1 â†’ Level 2 â†’ Level 3 (same as functional tests!)
âœ… Direct Mapping
Every functional test has a performance equivalent
âœ… Clear Goals
Each level has specific performance targets
âœ… Complete Documentation
Setup, run, analyze - everything covered
âœ… Production Ready
Level 3 simulates real production load

ðŸ“Š What Each Level Tests:
Level 1 (Basic) - 10 Users, 2 Minutes
âœ“ Registration performance
âœ“ Login performance (username & email)
âœ“ Get user info performance
âœ“ Basic load handling
Level 2 (Data-Driven) - 50 Users, 5 Minutes
âœ“ Extended registration with fields
âœ“ Multiple user profiles
âœ“ 3 load patterns (steady, ramping, spike)
âœ“ 1000+ operations
Level 3 (Advanced) - 200 Users, 17 Minutes
âœ“ Baseline (20 VUs, 3m)
âœ“ Stress test (50-150 VUs, 8m)
âœ“ Spike test (200 VUs, 50s)
âœ“ Soak test (30 VUs, 5m)
âœ“ 10,000+ requests

ðŸŽ“ Complete Testing Strategy:
Week 1: Functional Level 1 + Performance Level 1
Week 2: Functional Level 2 + Performance Level 2
Week 3: Functional Level 3 + Performance Level 3
Week 4: CI/CD Integration + Continuous Monitoring
